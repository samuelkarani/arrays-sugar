# arrays sugar

## What's this package?

Async versions of array functions with predicate callbacks e.g.

```
import { findIndex } from 'arrays-sugar'

const array = [1, 2, 3];
findIndex(array, async (number) => number === 2) // 1 ‚úÖ
array.findIndex(async (number) => number === 2) // 0 ‚ùå
```

Built with Typescript for Node.js or the Browser.

## What's in it?

A set of purely functional array methods with async predicates: `every`, `filter`, `find`, `findIndex`, `some`

These are used internally in the related **[AI Sugar](https://github.com/samuelkarani/ai-sugar)** package/library. Check it out especially if you're building or working with AI in Typescript/Node.js.

So each function has 2/3 versions:

- default version which is concurrent (uses `Promise.allSettled` internally) and is also available with the suffix `Concurrent`

```
   // both are equivalent
   [1, 2, 3].every(async (number) => number === 2) === true
   [1, 2, 3].everyConcurrent(async (number) => number === 2) === true
```

- optimized version that may not iterate the entire array on condition that the predicate `throws` for `falsy` values (instead of returning `false`). This is available for all except `filter` which has to go through the whole array. Uses the suffix `Optimized`.

```
    const result = await findOptimized(array, async (item) => {
      if (item <= 1) {
        throw new Error("error");
      }
      return true;
    });
```

- serial version that iterates one at a time (slow). Uses the suffix `Serial`.

```
    const result = await findIndexSerial(array, async (item) => {
      await sleep(100);
      return item > 1;
    });
```

## Why?

Using callbacks with promises or async/await inside findIndex always returns truthy for all items in the array.

If you try this in the console or node.js it will always return `false`

`[1, 2, 3].findIndex(async (number) => number === 2) === 1`

The same goes for `every`, `find`, `filter`, `some`

Outside `map` it seems only `reduce` can work with `promise` or `async`/`await` callbacks

<!-- Because most array functions with callbacks can't work with `promises` or `async`/`await` -->

```
const sum = await [1, 2, 3].reduce((accumulator, number) => {
  return accumulator.then(value => value + number)
}, Promise.resolve(0));
console.log(sum) // 6
```

### Coming soon

Async versions of:

1. `indexOf`
2. `lastIndexOf`
3. `findLast`
4. `findLastIndex`

## That's it!

Thanks for reading.
I welcome your input, suggestions, feedback. Here is the [medium article](https://medium.com/@samiezkay/8d70198ffc72) I wrote introducing this library.

Check out the following related libraries that I also built with this release.

[ai-sugar](https://github.com/samuelkarani/ai-sugar) AI Sugar is a collection of utility functions for working with AI apis.

```
const sorted = await ai.sort({
  array: ["green", "red", "blue", "yellow"],
  prompt: "rainbow color order",
});
// ["red", "yellow", "green", "blue"]
```

[zod-sugar](https://github.com/samuelkarani/zod-sugar) Zod Sugar is basically reverse zod i.e. creates a zod schema from a javascript value:

```
const object = { foo: "bar", baz: 1 };
const schema = createZod(object);
// z.object({ foo: z.string(), bar: z.number() });
schema.safeParse(object).success // true
```
